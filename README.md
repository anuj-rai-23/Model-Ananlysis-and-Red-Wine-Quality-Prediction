# Model-Ananlysis-and-Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
An attempt to study various ML models for predicting the quality of Red Wine using various performance measures.<br>
A project for [Machine Learning course (CS-503)](http://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/courses/s2020/cs503/cs503.html) done under supervision of [Dr. CK Narayanan](http://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/ckn/)

## Dataset 
[Kaggle Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/sgus1318/winedata?select=winequality_red.csv)
Dataset is heavily biased towards 3 classes. Converted it into a two class dataset and performed binary classification.

## ML Models used
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forests</li>
  <li>Random Gradient Boost</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  </ul>

## Performance Measures
<ul>
  <li>Train Accuracy</li>
  <li>Test Accuracy</li>
  <li>F1-Score</li>
  <li>Precision Score</li>
  <li>Recall </li>
  </ul>
